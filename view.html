            <p>Hello Sweet Heart&hearts;</p>
            <p>I Don't Know How To Say This Directly,But Every Time You Smile,It Feels Like The World Slows Down A Little - just For Me To Admire You.I've Been This In For Too long .. I Think I've Fallen For You</p>

            <p>"Thereâ€™s someone Iâ€™ve liked for a long timeâ€¦ not because theyâ€™re perfect, but because they make me feel seen in a world that usually overlooks me. I never had the courage to say it to their face, so I kept it all inside. Every conversation, every smile, every shared laugh meant more to me than theyâ€™ll ever know. Maybe theyâ€™ll read this someday and recognize itâ€™s about themâ€¦ or maybe itâ€™ll just stay my silent little truth." ðŸ’Œ</p>
